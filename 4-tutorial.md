2. API [application programming interface] (including SPARQL endpoints for linked data)

APIs allow you to query a database often with more flexibility than a user interface. You can display the results in your browser and also download them to use offline.

You can notice that API querys are managed through the URL:
https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/search.json?wskey=xxxx&query=lisa+NOT+mona

(You do need an API key to access the Europeana API Console)

The Old Bailey Online API Demonstrator is friendly place to start exploring how APIs work:

3. Download .sql files

Sometimes you will encounter entire MySQL (or other) databases available for download online.


## Exercise

We are going to explore the database from the [French Book Trade in Enlightenment Europe](http://fbtee.uws.edu.au/main/). Navigate over to this page, download the database, and then open up MAMP if you wish to follow along on your own computer.
