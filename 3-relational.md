- Part 3 explores the reasons why building a database can be useful for research.


# Why would you build a database?

- to generate knowledge
- to remember/capture
- to organize/retrieve
- to relate/associate


What is the database for? (What questions will it help answer? How will you use the database? What kinds of analyses?)





## When is Excel not enough?

Flat vs. Relational

### Flat

Flat databases contain only one table.

### Relational

Relational databases contain multiple tables that are linked through keys (or IDs).

## How do you create a database?

1. Develop the structure based on your goals and source material
 - determine what the rows and columns will be

####"Source-oriented"

If you are creating a database to replicate as much as possible an individual or set of similar sources, you may want to closely relate the design (the schema) to the original source structure.

####"Method-oriented"

If you are working at a composite level, you can design your database to capture specific kinds of information that will help you answer your research question. In this case it is important to document the provenance of the information in each cell.



2. Create a standardized data entry procedure
  - *minimize data transformations in the beginning*
  - *put only one piece of information in each cell*

3. Document where information originates
4. Document any data transformations (e.g. standardization of dates, etc.)
5. Begin collecting data in single sheets (Excel, Google sheets)


## A note on documentation
Document in whatever way makes sense to you.
- Github repository wikis are an excellent place to preserve documentation.





## What do you do with the database?
### Querying
SQL

### Visualizing/Mapping
Since databases record relationships, seeing these outside of table form or query results can be enlightening or help you demonstrate an argument.
