# When and Why to use a Database in the Humanities


When is Excel not enough? What kinds of databases are there? How do you get started building and using them? This introductory workshop teaches you why databases can be useful for humanities research, best practices in database design, and how to set up a relational database on your computer.

If you want to try setting up a database with a provided test dataset, please bring a laptop that is connected to the Stanford network.

This workshop is offered by Stanford Libraries' [Center for Interdisciplinary Research](http://library.stanford.edu/research/cidr) as part of its mission to provide training in technical academic research practices and applied research methods.

Taught by [Katie McDonough](https://library.stanford.edu/people/kmcdono2).
