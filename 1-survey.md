# Databases and the humanities

[Use]
1. Discovery
    - secondary sources (for ex. Searchworks, JSTOR)
    - primary sources (EBBO, Internet Archive, NETFLIX)
2. Query/Analysis
    - ARTFL
    - Hathitrust research environment





[Create]
1. Reference/bibliographic management (of research or teaching materials)
[and organization of notes]

Originally designed to help researchers document references for materials cited in research outputs. Many of these applications also included notes fields.

If the index card note-taking system is formally related to the card catalog era, these applications were designed to help researchers manage newly digitized library records.

- Refwords
- Endnote
- Mendeley
- Zotero




In time, applications adapted to help researchers organize information and ideas from other kinds of digital records.

2. Archive or fieldwork data management
    - bird's eye view of materials
    - information collated from many sources of different kinds
    - digitization of individual or sets of similar sources (and annotation)
    - digitization of an entire archival collection


As scholars move away from using pen and paper to take notes, many have adopted software that help organize  materials that do not have records designed by institutions using common metadata standards.

- Excel, Word, text files, etc.
- Filemaker pro
- Zotero (again)
- DEVONthink
- Evernote
- Scrivener
- Tropy (images + metadata + notes)



Finally, we come full circle to databases that are at the foundation of research outputs in humanities projects.

[Critical Perspectives]

- "Database as Symbolic Form" (Manovich)

What is new about digital databases if humanists use them to mimic index cards?

What is the relationship between database and narrative? ()
